Hi!

I hope you enjoy this early version of my remake of the AMIGA/C64 classic "The Great Giana Sisters". All the program code is 100% by myself, the graphics however are taken from the AMIGA version of the game and are copyrighted by the Spellbound AG, Germany. (I guess...)

my goal is to make a remake of the game including all the levels and a usable level-editor.

There is no need to send me feedback on the quality of the game and code. I'm currently rewriting most of it to make it more efficient and easier to work with.

P.S. Hope you also like the wintery-touch the snowflakes add... :-)
P.P.S. I am neither the writer of the original AMIGA game nor am I the first one to create a remake. Please check out the following links if you looking for a more advanced version of a remake...
